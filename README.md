Freetable-File-Server
=====================

A basic file server for Freetable.  This is an almost complete working mockup.

Requirements
=====================
  * MongoDB
  * Ruby 1.9.x or better
  * Rubygems and the mongo gem installed

Just run the script from the file and away you go.  You can use mongofiles to save files for now into grid fs.  Make sure you use the --db Freetable switch on the commandline.
